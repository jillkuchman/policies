# Portland Junior Developers Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of Portland Junior Developers is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Portland Junior Developers to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable‭ ‬behaviors‭ ‬include:‭ ‬intimidating,‭ ‬harassing,‭ ‬abusive,‭ ‬discriminatory,‭ ‬derogatory‭ ‬or‭ ‬demeaning‭ ‬speech‭ ‬or‭ ‬actions‭ ‬by‭ ‬any‭ ‬participant‭ ‬in‭ ‬our‭ ‬community‭ ‬online,‭ ‬at‭ ‬all‭ ‬related‭ ‬events‭, ‬and‭ ‬in‭ ‬one-on-one‭ ‬communications‭ ‬carried‭ ‬out‭ ‬in‭ ‬the‭ ‬context‭ ‬of‭ ‬community‭ ‬business.‭ Jokes and attempts at humor that cross into this threshold are not permissible and we ask that attendees exercise appropriate discretion in moments of jest. Regardless of intention, being aggressive, mean, or degrading towards others is also off limits.

We want Portland Junior Developer activities to remain safe and inclusive for individuals of all gender identities. Failing to refer to other people by their desired pronouns is transphobic and will not be tolerated.

Harassment‭ ‬includes:‭ ‬harmful‭ ‬or‭ ‬prejudicial‭ ‬verbal‭ ‬or‭ ‬written‭ ‬comments‭ ‬related‭ ‬to‭ ‬gender,‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬orientation,‭ ‬race,‭ ‬religion,‭ ‬disability‭; ‬inappropriate‭ ‬use‭ ‬of‭ ‬nudity‭ ‬and/or‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬images‭ ‬in‭ ‬public‭ ‬spaces‭ (‬including‭ ‬presentation‭ ‬slides‭); ‬deliberate‭ ‬intimidation,‭ ‬stalking‭ ‬or‭ ‬following‭; ‬harassing‭ ‬photography‭ ‬or‭ ‬recording‭; ‬sustained‭ ‬disruption‭ ‬of‭ ‬talks‭ ‬or‭ ‬other‭ ‬events‭; ‬inappropriate‭ ‬physical‭ ‬contact,‭ ‬and‭ ‬unwelcome‭ ‬sexual‭ ‬attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬from‭ ‬any‭ ‬community‭ ‬member,‭ ‬including‭ ‬sponsors‭ ‬and‭ ‬those‭ ‬with‭ ‬decision-making‭ ‬authority,‭ ‬will‭ ‬not‭ ‬be‭ ‬tolerated.

Anyone‭ ‬asked‭ ‬to‭ ‬stop‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior‭ ‬is‭ ‬expected‭ ‬to‭ ‬comply‭ ‬immediately. If‭ ‬a‭ ‬community‭ ‬member‭ ‬engages‭ ‬in‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behavior,‭  the‭ ‬community‭ ‬organizers‭ ‬may‭ ‬take‭ ‬any‭ ‬action‭ ‬they‭ ‬deem‭ ‬appropriate,‭ ‬up‭ ‬to‭ ‬and‭ ‬including‭ ‬a‭ ‬temporary‭ ‬ban‭ ‬or‭ ‬permanent‭ ‬expulsion‭ ‬from‭ ‬the‭ ‬community‭ ‬without‭ ‬warning‭ (‬and‭ ‬without‭ ‬refund‭ ‬in‭ ‬the‭ ‬case‭ ‬of‭ ‬a‭ ‬paid‭ ‬event‭)‬.

## Prohibited Items

Weapons, drugs, and items that possess hypersexualized, violent, and/or hateful imagery or messaging are prohibited at Portland Junior Developer events.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
